# **SuperGrid**
_A super awesome jQuery plugin to render a grid out of an array of data._

### Introduction
<p>
This plugin seeks to provide easy to use functionality for rendering
tabular data (building a <i>grid</i>) in all manners of web development situations. Primarily this
project has two goals:
<br><br>
1. The leading principle is to maximize ease of use by minimization of the understanding curve.
Simply speaking, for its complexity it should be easy to modify, customize and learn the source of this plugin.
Which is not to imply that it is required that you make any attempt to do so, but that you can if so motivated.
Additionally, many provisions will be made for customizability and flexibility.
<br><br>
2. Provide for flexibility out of the box that can accommodate many use cases that may not be in the
interest of technical progress, but are required nonetheless. This flexibility will manifest itself
in the form of providing different rendering/build options and features that seek to provide baseline functionality
and/or starting places for the developer to start with.
<br><br>
......... And with out further ado lets jump right in.
